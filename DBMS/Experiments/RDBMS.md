 **Experiment 2**

**Aim: Introduction to Relational Database Management System**

**SQL (Structured Query Language)**
SQL is a standard programming language used to manage and manipulate relational databases. It allows users to perform various operations on data, such as querying, inserting, updating, and deleting. SQL is a declarative language, meaning users specify *what* they want rather than *how* to do it.

* **Key Features:**

  * Querying and retrieving data.
  * Managing database schemas.
  * Enforcing data security.
  * Supporting transactions for data consistency.

**SQL History**

* **1970**: E.F. Codd proposed the relational model in his research paper, which formed the theoretical foundation for SQL.
* **1974**: SQL was developed by IBM researchers Donald D. Chamberlin and Raymond F. Boyce as part of their System R project, originally called "SEQUEL" (Structured English Query Language).
* **1986**: SQL became a standard when ANSI (American National Standards Institute) and ISO (International Organization for Standardization) formalized it.
* **Present**: SQL continues to evolve with modern database systems, introducing extensions for JSON, XML, and geographic data.

**Types of SQL Commands:**
SQL commands are categorized based on their functionality:

* **Data Definition Language (DDL):**
  Defines and modifies the structure of the database and its objects (tables, indexes, etc.).

  **Commands:**

  * **CREATE**: Create new objects (e.g., tables, databases).
  * **ALTER**: Modify existing database objects.
  * **DROP**: Delete objects like tables or databases.
