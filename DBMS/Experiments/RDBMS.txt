 **Experiment 2**

**Aim: Introduction to Relational Database Management System**

**SQL (Structured Query Language)**
SQL is a standard programming language used to manage and manipulate relational databases. It allows users to perform various operations on data, such as querying, inserting, updating, and deleting. SQL is a declarative language, meaning users specify *what* they want rather than *how* to do it.

* **Key Features:**

  * Querying and retrieving data.
  * Managing database schemas.
  * Enforcing data security.
  * Supporting transactions for data consistency.

**SQL History**

* **1970**: E.F. Codd proposed the relational model in his research paper, which formed the theoretical foundation for SQL.
* **1974**: SQL was developed by IBM researchers Donald D. Chamberlin and Raymond F. Boyce as part of their System R project, originally called "SEQUEL" (Structured English Query Language).
* **1986**: SQL became a standard when ANSI (American National Standards Institute) and ISO (International Organization for Standardization) formalized it.
* **Present**: SQL continues to evolve with modern database systems, introducing extensions for JSON, XML, and geographic data.

**Types of SQL Commands:**
SQL commands are categorized based on their functionality:

* **Data Definition Language (DDL):**
  Defines and modifies the structure of the database and its objects (tables, indexes, etc.).

  **Commands:**

  * **CREATE**: Create new objects (e.g., tables, databases).
  * **ALTER**: Modify existing database objects.
  * **DROP**: Delete objects like tables or databases.

TRUNCATE:Remove all rows from table without logging individual row deletions

Data Manipulation Language (DML):
Manipulates data stored in the database.

Commands:

INSERT: Add new data to a table.

UPDATE: Modify existing data.

DELETE: Remove specific data from a table.

TRUNCATE: Remove all rows from a table without logging individual row deletions.

Data Query Language (DQL):
Used to query and retrieve data from the database.

Command:

SELECT: Retrieve data from tables with optional filtering, sorting, and grouping.

Data Control Language (DCL):
Manages user access and permissions.

Commands:

GRANT: Provide privileges to users.

REVOKE: Remove privileges from users.

Transaction Control Language (TCL):
Manages transactions within a database.

Commands:

COMMIT: Save changes permanently.

ROLLBACK: Revert changes to the last save point.

SAVEPOINT: Set a point within a transaction to which changes can be rolled back.

Data Types in SQL:
SQL supports various data types to define the kind of data a column can store:

Numeric Data Types:
INT or INTEGER: Whole numbers.

FLOAT, REAL, or DOUBLE: Floating-point numbers.

DECIMAL or NUMERIC: Precise decimal numbers (e.g., salaries, prices).

String Data Types:
CHAR(n): Fixed-length string (e.g., CHAR(10) stores 10 characters).

VARCHAR(n): Variable-length string (e.g., VARCHAR(50) stores up to 50 characters).

TEXT: Large text data.

Date and Time Data Types:
DATE: Stores date values (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD).

TIME: Stores time values (e.g., HH:MM:SS).

TIMESTAMP: Stores date and time together.

Boolean Data Type:
BOOLEAN: Stores TRUE, FALSE, or NULL.

Binary Data Types:
BLOB (Binary Large Object): Stores binary data like images and files.
